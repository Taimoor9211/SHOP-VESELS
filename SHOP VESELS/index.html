        <h1>About the Founder</h1>
        <p>
          Vessels embodies what I needed during my battle with anxiety and deep
          depression years ago—a brand that understands your process to
          wholeness. Through self-inquiry, I've realized the profound power of
          inner healing and realized, in the universal truth of oneness. I'm
          deeply passionate about sharing the NOW Method with the world. Now, as
          a Meditation teacher, Breathwork Facilitator and Integration Coach, I
          aim to hold space for others as they discover this truth within
          themselves. Acknowledging the self, plant medicine, meditation,
          fasting and breathwork have been pivotal in my personal journey, and I
          believe in their potential for global healing
